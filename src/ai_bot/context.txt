Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics supports scientific contacts with many universities around the world. Each summer our best students go to the Otto-von-Guericke University (Magdeburg, Germany) for training. Due to the close collaboration with leading IT-companies (such as EPAM Systems, Itransition, HiQo Solutions, IBA Group, Qulix Systems and other) our students have an excellent opportunity to get practical and pre-diploma professional practice with further job placement.
The graduates who have demonstrated high level of research skills receive recommendations for admission to master’s course and postgraduate course.
Our students are the most active in social and research activities of the university. The faculty has the Student Union, Quality Education Council, Creative Union and others. Every week faculty activists hold film screenings and board games in addition to annual events.
Studying at the Faculty of Mechanics and Mathematics is interesting and fun! It’s where the highest quality of education and active student life meet!
